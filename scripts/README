SCRIPTS
=======

This folder contains scripts for the Carmenta project.

install_app.sh
--------------

Use this script to install the Carmenta manually, not using the recommended COPR repository and COPR package. The output will be the same.

install_extension.sh
--------------------

Use this script to install the Carmenta backend extension allowing you to simultanously copy & insert desired emoji instantly.
The application WILL work without it, it's just for speeding things up. 

I highly recommend you to INSTALL this one.

package_extension.sh
--------------------

You will NOT need this one. It's just my script to create zip packages required for gnome-extensions to be published. I use it to apply patches.

I mean, you can use it, if you for some magic reason need a zip package of this extension.
